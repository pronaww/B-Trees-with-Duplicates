# B-Trees-with-Duplicates
The goal of this assignment is to get some practice with binary search trees, specifically B-Trees. B-Trees are one of the most important data structures we will study in this class â€“ they are regularly used in large database systems for storing indexes on the records. However, just for fun, we will make one significant departure from standard B-trees. We will allow duplicate keys, i.e., a tree can have an unbounded number of keys that have the same value.
